## Fork from the [Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks official github](https://github.com/Tiiiger/SGC) 

The reason for this fork is that we wanted a clean repo where we only kept the code that was relevant to our work. If you find this repo useful, please cite the original paper (not from us):
